Here is a basic analysis on Coffee Sales of Two years with 50 customers.
I performed some basic analysis on when is the highest sales done in a year with graph showing the results.
Also there are categories of coffee beans that are being sold in different countries this data can be useful to maximize the profits by focusing on the specific category of the beans.
There are graphs displaying various information about the sales with appropriate dates and information.
